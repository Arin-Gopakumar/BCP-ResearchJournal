            <p class="paper-title">Harnessing Convolutional Neural Networks for Coccidioidomycosis Prediction through Dust Detection in the Southwest United States based on NASA's EOSDIS Worldview Imaging</p>
            <p class="paper-author">Arin Gopakumar '25</p>
            <p class="paper-abstract">Valley Fever, a respiratory disease caused by the Coccidioides fungus, is native
            to the soil of arid areas like the Southwestern United States and poses
            significant public health challenges. The disease's prevalence and diagnosis
            delay are closely linked to environmental conditions, particularly those
            influencing the distribution and dispersion of fungal spores, such as soil
            disturbance by the wind. Recognizing the critical need for advanced detection
            and prevention mechanisms of Valley Fever, this study leverages the capabilities
            of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify and predict hazardous
            dust conditions conducive to the dispersal of Coccidioides spores using
            NASA's Earth Observing Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Worldview
            Satellite Imagery. The findings from this research indicate a significant
            advancement in monitoring and forecasting environmental conditions
            associated with Valley Fever outbreaks. The CNN model demonstrates a
            notable performance in detecting dust-related events over traditional methods
            such as Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), offering a promising tool for early
            warning systems. By facilitating real-time monitoring of dust conditions, this
            research contributes to preemptively managing Valley Fever risk by reducing
            incidence rates via timely public health interventions.</p>

            <p class="paper-author">Ryan Zerbib '25</p>
            <p class="paper-abstract">Climate change poses an existential threat to humanity, yet implementing effective
            policies to mitigate its impacts has proven challenging due to the need for widespread
            public support. Environmental concern (EC) among the general populace is a crucial
            factor influencing climate policy adoption. This study evaluates the relative
            determinants of EC in the United States and how those factors have evolved over the
            past decade by analyzing data from the 2020 International Social Survey Programme
            using linear regression analysis. Building upon prior research utilizing the same data
            source from 2010, this investigation offers updated insights into demographic
            characteristics, values/trust indicators, and economic factors underlying EC levels. Key
            findings include gender, age, governmental trust, and relative income as significant
            predictors of EC, with women, younger individuals, those with higher trust in
            government, and higher-income groups exhibiting heightened concern.</p>

            <p class="paper-author">Dean Ketcham '25</p>
            <p class="paper-abstract">This research demonstrates that consumers underestimate the amount of time that has
                elapsed while scrolling on social media vs. watching a TV show, and is the first to
                demonstrate a causal relationship between the infinite scrolling on social media and
                cognitive time. Importantly, despite the fact that consumers do indeed lose track of
                time while scrolling on social media, it shows that consumers perceive time to have
                passed at a normal rate, meaning that they are unaware of any changes in cognitive time
                (an individual's subjective perception of time).</p>

            <p class="paper-author">Marco Pannozzo '25</p>
            <p class="paper-abstract">This study aims to describe how the male diet is portrayed within the fitness industry
            on the social media platform TikTok. I used qualitative content analysis of selected
            popular TikTok videos on the topic of bodybuilding, defined as the effort to become
            more lean and toned. Bodybuilding is the most prominent form of male fitness
            content on social media and has been extensively studied. The way that social media
            use interacts with body image and fitness efforts is dynamic and a prevalent area of
            future research. The current body of research has established a link between social
            media use and body image concerns that lead to disordered or altered eating habits,
            however, the content itself surrounding bodybuilding on social media has not been
            analyzed. This study aims to fill that gap and broaden the understanding of how social
            media influences how males eat.</p>

            <p class="paper-author">Santiago Paul '25</p>
            <p class="paper-abstract">Religion and reading play important roles in the daily life of any given individual,
            influencing their behavior, community, and worldview. However, the relationship
            between how these two factors influence the other remains understudied, as while it is
            known the religion can influence behavior, which can in turn influence reading
            interests, studies have merely looked at the two in isolation, and never together.
            Similarly, many have drawn conclusions that the values present within fantasy
            literature are “at odds” with that of many religions, but no study has drawn
            conclusions from lived individual experiences, but rather based solely on moral
            conjectures. Thus, the goal of this research is to identify whether religiosity and reading
            interest, specifically regarding fantasy literature, are correlated with each other, to
            determine if they are indeed strong influencing factors. Utilizing a Likert model survey,
            responses were correlated with one another to determine if the two values were
            positively, or negatively correlated. Ultimately, it was determined that there was
            marginally significant correlation between the two, however large distinctions were
            discovered between the different subgroups involved; specifically surrounding age and
            subject interest. Thus, the paper attempts to guide future research in the direction of
            drawing conclusions based on the smaller, more nuanced subgroups, rather than
            attempting to make sweeping claims that may be unfounded.</p>

            <p class="paper-title">Influence of Language on Emotional Reflection: A Study of Spanish Bilinguals</p>
            <p class="paper-author">Rowdy Benear '25</p>
            <p class="paper-abstract">This study investigated how bilingual Spanish-English speakers experience and express
            emotions differently across their two languages. Ten Hispanic-American male high
            school students participated in structured interviews about emotional experiences,
            conducted separately in English and Spanish. Participants also completed the Positive
            and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) questionnaire before, between, and after the
            interviews to assess changes in mood state. Qualitative analysis of the interview
            transcripts revealed three prominent themes: 1) happiness from relationships and goal
            attainment, 2) stress and anxiety around major life transitions, and 3) strong ties to
            family and cultural identity. Quantitative analysis showed that positive affect increased
            while negative affect decreased over the course of the interviews, with the most
            substantial shift occurring after the Spanish interview. Additionally, specific emotional
            markers like "happy" and "proud" were expressed with greater intensity and frequency
            in Spanish compared to English. The findings suggest that these bilingual participants
            experienced heightened emotional resonance, particularly for positive and
            culture-related emotions when using their native Spanish language. Implications for
            counseling approaches, supporting cultural identities, academic settings, and the
            benefits of bilingualism are discussed. Although mainly limited by a small sample, this
            study contributes insights into the complex interplay between language and emotional
            reflection.</p>
